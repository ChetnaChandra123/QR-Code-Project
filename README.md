About the Project

This is a simple QR Code Generator built using Node.js.
When you run the program in your terminal, it asks you to enter a URL.
After entering the URL, the program:

Generates a QR code image (qr_img.png)

Saves the entered URL into a text file (URL.txt)

You can then scan the QR code using your phone to instantly visit the website!

⚙️ Features

📥 Takes user input directly from the terminal

🧾 Converts the URL into a QR code image

💾 Stores the entered URL in a text file

⚡ Runs completely on Node.js (no browser needed)
